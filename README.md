This is where the work happens from freshehr for Nictiz. They asked us to do a fit gap between CKM archetypes and EHDS logical models for the 6 core concepts from EPS.
We decided to change (a copy of) the openEHR IPS embedded templates, to fit the logical models. Those templates are in /local. In /mapping there’s a CSV export of those templates, which will have a column with comments. And a column with the FHIR path (for each openEHR path).# openEHR standard project structure
This is a standard structure oroginally developed by freshEHR for openEHR-related projects.
